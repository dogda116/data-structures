# data-structures
My implementations of some data structures

* Heap ― implementation of max-heap and heapsort.  
  Note: The calling of heapsort will modify the heap object and max-heap property will not be supported

* Trie (Prefix Tree) ― data structure for effective word (prefix) searching in word dictionary
* Fenwick Tree (Binary Index Tree) ― data structure that can efficiently update elements and calculate prefix sums in a table of numbers.
